# techbot
Full source of an old project called QueerTech primarily focusing on layer 7/frontend ddo-s attacks.

Theres alot in this source so im too lazy to explain how to fire it up but it has a admin panel with key system and allat with local database creation, 
it also works with c99 api which is a cheap networking/web api and api's you connect to it to make attacks or tool commands. 
In our circumstance we made our own API then connected it to the bot to make the flow more stream lined.
